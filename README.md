# Zendesk Character Counter

## Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable**: Customize limits, colors, and keywords

- üîÑ **Auto-detection**: Works with modern Zendesk interface

## Visual Indicators

**Default settings:**
- **Gray**: Normal count (0-300 characters)
- **Orange**: Approaching limit (301-350 characters) 
- **Dark Red**: Over limit (351+ characters)

**Note**: Colors only appear when ticket subjects contain your configured keywords (unless disabled).

## Configuration

All settings can be easily customized by editing the top section of the script:

### Character Limits
```javascript
const WARNING_THRESHOLD = 300;  // When to show warning color
const DANGER_THRESHOLD = 350;   // When to show danger color
```

### Colors
```javascript
const NORMAL_COLOR = '#666';    // Gray for normal count
const WARNING_COLOR = '#ff8800'; // Orange for approaching limit
const DANGER_COLOR = '#cc0000';  // Dark red for over limit
```

### Keyword Filtering
```javascript
// Show warnings only for tickets containing these keywords
const TRIGGER_KEYWORDS = [
    'social media',
    'twitter',
    'facebook',
    'instagram',
    'public response'
];

// To show warnings for ALL tickets, use:
const TRIGGER_KEYWORDS = [];
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Tampermonkey browser extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

### Steps
1. **Install Tampermonkey** in your browser ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tampermonkey/id1482490089), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd))
2. **Click this link** to install the script: [zendesk-character-counter.user.js](https://github.com/igotdes/zendesk-character-counter/raw/refs/heads/main/zendesk-character-counter.user.js)
3. **Click "Install"** when Tampermonkey prompts you
4. **Navigate to Zendesk** and start typing in a ticket response

That's it! The character counter will automatically appear in the bottom-right of your composer toolbar.

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **Modern Zendesk interface** (tested and confirmed)
- ‚ùì Classic Zendesk interface (untested - may work)
- ‚ùì Rich text editors (untested - may work)
- ‚ùì Plain text areas (untested - may work)
- ‚úÖ All major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Usage

The counter appears automatically in the lower-right corner of the text editor when you:
1. Click into a Zendesk ticket response field
2. Start typing your response
3. Navigate between different tickets

**Keyword Filtering**: By default, color warnings only appear for tickets whose subjects contain your configured keywords. This helps focus attention on responses where character limits matter most.

**All Tickets Mode**: Set `TRIGGER_KEYWORDS = []` to show warnings for every ticket.

## Character Limit Guidelines

The default script uses a 350-character warning threshold, which is commonly used for:
- Social media responses
- SMS/text message limits
- Brief, concise support responses
- Internal team guidelines

## Customization Examples

### Social Media Team Setup
```javascript
const WARNING_THRESHOLD = 200;
const DANGER_THRESHOLD = 280;
const TRIGGER_KEYWORDS = ['twitter', 'facebook', 'instagram', 'social media'];
```

### Customer Success Team
```javascript
const WARNING_THRESHOLD = 500;
const DANGER_THRESHOLD = 750;
const TRIGGER_KEYWORDS = ['escalation', 'complaint', 'urgent'];
```

### SMS Support Team
```javascript
const WARNING_THRESHOLD = 140;
const DANGER_THRESHOLD = 160;
const TRIGGER_KEYWORDS = []; // Show for all tickets
```

### Custom Color Scheme
```javascript
const NORMAL_COLOR = '#4a90e2';   // Blue
const WARNING_COLOR = '#f5a623';  // Amber
const DANGER_COLOR = '#d0021b';   // Bright red
```

## Troubleshooting

### Counter not appearing?
1. Make sure Tampermonkey is enabled
2. Check that the script is active in Tampermonkey dashboard
3. Refresh the Zendesk page
