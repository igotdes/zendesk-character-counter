# Zendesk Character Counter

A minimalist Tampermonkey script that adds a real-time character counter to Zendesk support responses. Perfect for keeping track of response length and staying within character limits.

## Features

- üî¢ **Real-time counting**: Updates as you type
- üé® **Color-coded warnings**: Visual feedback for character limits
- üìç **Smart positioning**: Integrates seamlessly with Zendesk toolbar
- üîÑ **Auto-detection**: Works with both classic and modern Zendesk interfaces
- ‚ö° **Lightweight**: Minimal performance impact

## Visual Indicators

- **Gray**: Normal count (0-300 characters)
- **Orange**: Approaching limit (301-350 characters) 
- **Dark Red**: Over limit (351+ characters)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Tampermonkey browser extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

### Steps
1. **Install Tampermonkey** in your browser ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tampermonkey/id1482490089), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd))
2. **Click this link** to install the script: [zendesk-character-counter.user.js](https://github.com/igotdes/zendesk-character-counter/raw/refs/heads/main/zendesk-character-counter.user.js)
3. **Click "Install"** when Tampermonkey prompts you
4. **Navigate to Zendesk** and start typing in a ticket response

That's it! The character counter will automatically appear in the bottom-right of your composer toolbar.

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **Modern Zendesk interface** (tested and confirmed)
- ‚ùì Classic Zendesk interface (untested - may work)
- ‚ùì Rich text editors (untested - may work)
- ‚ùì Plain text areas (untested - may work)
- ‚úÖ All major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Usage

The counter appears automatically when you:
1. Click into a Zendesk ticket response field
2. Start typing your response
3. Navigate between different tickets

No configuration needed - it just works!

## Character Limit Guidelines

The default script uses a 350-character warning threshold, which is commonly used for:
- Social media responses
- SMS/text message limits
- Brief, concise support responses
- Internal team guidelines

You can modify these limits by editing the script (see [Customization](#customization) below).

## Customization

### Changing Character Limits
Edit these lines in the script to adjust warning thresholds:
```javascript
if (charCount > 350) {        // Over limit threshold
if (charCount > 300) {        // Warning threshold
```

### Changing Colors
Modify the color values:
```javascript
counter.style.color = '#cc0000'; // Dark red for over limit
counter.style.color = '#ff8800'; // Orange for warning
counter.style.color = '#666';    // Gray for normal
```

### Changing Position
Adjust the positioning in the CSS:
```javascript
right: 10px;  // Distance from right edge
```

## Troubleshooting

### Counter not appearing?
1. Make sure Tampermonkey is enabled
2. Check that the script is active in Tampermonkey dashboard
3. Refresh the Zendesk page
4. Try clicking in different text areas

### Counter showing wrong count?
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for debug messages starting with "Raw text length"
3. [Create an issue](../../issues) with the console output

### Not working on your Zendesk instance?
Different Zendesk configurations might need adjustment. [Open an issue](../../issues) with your Zendesk URL format.
